# Deployment Guide

## Issue Summary
The deployment was failing because:
- Vite builds static files to `dist/public/`
- Replit deployment expects files in `dist/`
- This mismatch caused the deployment to look for `index.html` in the wrong location

## Quick Solution

### Option 1: Run the build and fix process
```bash
npm run build
node quick-deploy-fix.js
```

### Option 2: Use the comprehensive build script
```bash
node build-deploy.js
```

### Option 3: Use the original fix script
```bash
npm run build
node deploy-fix.js
```

## How It Works

1. **Build Process**: Vite outputs files to `dist/public/` (unchangeable configuration)
2. **Structure Fix**: Scripts copy files from `dist/public/` to `dist/` for deployment
3. **Server Protection**: Preserves any existing server files in `dist/`
4. **Verification**: Ensures `index.html` is in the correct location

## Expected Final Structure
```
dist/
├── index.html          # Main HTML file (from dist/public/)
├── assets/             # Static assets (CSS, JS bundles)
├── *.css               # Stylesheet files
├── *.js                # JavaScript bundles (client)
└── index.js            # Server file (from esbuild)
```

## Verification
After running the fix:
- `dist/index.html` should exist
- Static assets should be in `dist/assets/`
- Server files should remain intact
- Deployment should work correctly

## Scripts Explanation

- **quick-deploy-fix.js**: Fast, simple fix for existing builds
- **deploy-fix.js**: Comprehensive fix with detailed logging
- **build-deploy.js**: Complete build and deployment preparation

The deployment structure is now correct and ready for Replit deployment.
