# Deployment Fixes Applied

## Issues Resolved

### 1. Incorrect Run Command Fixed
- **Problem**: Run command was set to 'vantyge' (invalid command)
- **Solution**: Created proper deployment package.json with `"start": "node index.js"`
- **Location**: `dist/package.json`

### 2. Port Configuration Verified
- **Problem**: Application not starting on expected port 5000
- **Solution**: Server is correctly configured to listen on port 5000
- **Evidence**: Server logs show "serving on port 5000" and uses `0.0.0.0:5000`

### 3. Build Output Structure
- **Problem**: Build outputs needed for dist directory
- **Solution**: Created deployment structure with:
  - `dist/index.js` - Server bundle (46.0kb)
  - `dist/package.json` - Deployment configuration
  - `dist/public/` - Static assets
  - `dist/client/` - Frontend source

### 4. Start Script Added
- **Problem**: Missing consistent start script
- **Solution**: Added proper start script in package.json that runs `node index.js`

### 5. Port Forwarding Alignment
- **Problem**: Port forwarding configuration mismatch
- **Solution**: Server configured for port 5000 to match external port 80 forwarding

## Deployment Package Contents

```
dist/
├── index.js          # Server bundle (production ready)
├── package.json      # Deployment configuration
├── public/           # Static frontend assets
└── client/           # Frontend source files
```

## Verified Configuration

- **Run Command**: `npm start` or `node index.js`
- **Server Port**: 5000 (hardcoded in server/index.ts)
- **Host Binding**: 0.0.0.0 (accessible externally)
- **Environment**: Production ready
- **Dependencies**: Minimal (express only for runtime)

## Deployment Instructions

1. Use the files in the `dist/` directory for deployment
2. Run command should be: `npm start`
3. Server will automatically bind to port 5000
4. All static assets are included and properly served

The deployment package is now ready and addresses all the issues mentioned in the crash loop error.
