# Deployment Fix Documentation

## Issue Summary
The deployment was failing because:
- Vite builds static files to `dist/public/`
- Replit deployment expects files in `dist/`
- This mismatch caused the deployment to look for `index.html` in the wrong location

## Solution Applied

### 1. Fixed Import Path Issues
Updated all component imports from alias paths (`@/lib/utils`) to relative paths (`../../lib/utils`) to resolve build failures.

### 2. Created Deployment Fix Scripts
- `deploy-fix.js` - Copies built files from `dist/public/` to `dist/` for correct deployment structure
- `build-deploy.js` - Complete build and deployment preparation script

## How to Deploy

### Option 1: Use the Fix Script
```bash
# After building
npm run build
node deploy-fix.js
```

### Option 2: Use the Complete Build Script
```bash
node build-deploy.js
```

## Files Modified
- All UI components: Fixed import paths from `@/lib/utils` to `../../lib/utils`
- App.tsx: Fixed component import paths
- Contact form: Fixed import paths
- Page components: Fixed import paths

## Expected Deployment Structure
After running the fix:
```
dist/
├── index.html          # Main HTML file (copied from dist/public/)
├── assets/             # Static assets (copied from dist/public/assets/)
├── *.css               # Stylesheet files
├── *.js                # JavaScript bundles
└── index.js            # Server file (from esbuild)
```

## Verification
The deployment should now work correctly as:
1. Static files are in the expected `dist/` directory
2. All import paths resolve correctly during build
3. The server and client files coexist properly

This fix maintains the existing development setup while ensuring deployment compatibility.
